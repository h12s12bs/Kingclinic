# Kingclinic WebSite with Sharing Decision-Making in Knee Osteoarthritis Using the AHP-FMCGP Method
# Abstract
This study has developed a clinical treatment decision support system (CTDSS) that the clinicians can simplify the shared-decision making (SDM) process for treating Osteoarthritis of the Knee (OA knee). This system enables patients to participate and decide on the best treatment approach. Many countries worldwide have been advocating SDM, but its practical implementation in clinical setting has posed challenges. We incorporated analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy multiple-choice goal programming (AHP-FMCGP) into CTDSS to determine treatment standards through a literature review and expert surveys. This provided patients with flexibility in modifying treatment goals and constraints during the decision-making (DM) process to achieve their preferred treatment and simplifying the traditional SDM. We invited 240 knee osteoarthritis patients to participate in a pilot study, and the results indicated a significant improvement in patient satisfaction (F=4.104; P<0.05) with the implementation of CTDSS. This study not only demonstrates the effectiveness of CTDSS but also resolves the challenges in clinical implementation The advantages of CTDSS include: (1) Improve the efficiency of implementing SDM, promoting better clinician-patient communication and higher healthcare quality. (2) Elimination of the need for extensive health literacy and disease knowledge from patients during DM process. (3) Saving time for physicians, allowing them to better understand the patientsâ€™ preferences and select the most appropriate treatment option even in busy clinical environment. (4) This method can be extended to all primary clinics to benefit patients.
