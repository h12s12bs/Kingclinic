# Kingclinic WebSite with a Real-Time Clinical Shared Decision Support System (CSDSS)
# Abstract
We implement a real-time Clinical Shared Decision Support System (CSDSS) to address challenges in healthcare settings regarding shared decision-making (SDM). The CSDSS is built on a Web Model-View-Controller architecture, incorporating various components to facilitate informed treatment decisions. One of the key features is the utilization of a generative adversarial network and EfficientNetB7, enabling automatic diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis grades based on the Kellgren-Lawrence scale. To enhance the decision-making process, we introduce a novel subjective-objective multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method, combining the entropy weight method and fuzzy multiple-choice goal programming. This approach overcomes limitations of traditional MCDM techniques, providing a more comprehensive and accurate decision framework. The benefits of the CSDSS are manifold. It offers unbiased evidence-based medicine information to support treatment decisions, thereby improving the transparency and quality of medical decision-making. The system also enables the development of individualized treatment plans that consider patients' preferences and goals, resulting in increased treatment flexibility and patient satisfaction. In fact, patient satisfaction significantly increased from 3.202 to 4.081 on the Likert scale (F=8.239; p<0.05). CSDSS enhances communication between healthcare professionals and patients, thereby increasing patient engagement and facilitating patient-centered care. Physicians reported a higher average user satisfaction score of 3.795 (Likert scale) after implementing the CSDSS, which is significantly higher than the score of 2.635 (Likert scale) when using the current SDM aid. The results demonstrate a significant correlation (F=5.145; p<0.05), indicating that the implementation of CSDSS effectively reduces unnecessary treatments, resolves medical disputes, reduces labor costs, and alleviates the burden on doctors. In conclusion, the CSDSS is an invaluable tool for implementing SDM, accelerating effective treatment, and promoting precision medicine within the challenges of a busy clinical setting. By incorporating advanced technologies and innovative decision-making methods, the CSDSS empowers healthcare professionals to make informed decisions, ultimately benefiting both patients and medical practitioners.
